# SLAM & Path Planning (ROS2)

This repository contains my work on SLAM and path planning using ROS2 (Humble) and TurtleBot3 in Gazebo simulation. It includes configuration files, generated maps, and parameter tuning for the Nav2 stack.

Detailed progress and planner comparisons are documented in [my_progress.md](my_progress.md).
